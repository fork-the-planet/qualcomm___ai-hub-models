# [Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct: Multimodal 8B vision-language model with enhanced visual reasoning capabilities](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen3_vl_8b_instruct)

Qwen3-VL is a vision-language model from Alibaba Cloud capable of understanding both text and images for multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning.

This is based on the implementation of Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct found [here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct).
This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance across various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen3_vl_8b_instruct).

Qualcomm AI Hub Models uses [Qualcomm AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com) to compile, profile, and evaluate this model. [Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.

## Quick Start

Use our lightweight command-line interface to inspect and download Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct:

```bash
pip install qai_hub_models_cli # (the CLI is also available with the qai-hub-models package)

# Inspect the model and list the available download options
qai-hub-models info Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct

# Print performance and accuracy metrics
qai-hub-models perf Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct
qai-hub-models numerics Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct

# Download a ready-to-deploy asset
qai-hub-models fetch Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct --runtime geniex_qairt --precision w4a16
```
See the [CLI README](../../../../cli/README.md)
for the full list of commands and filters.

## Deploying Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct on-device

Follow the [GenieX quickstart](https://geniex.aihub.qualcomm.com/en/get-started/quickstart) to install GenieX and deploy the model on a target device.

See the [LLM-on-Genie](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-apps/tree/main/tutorials/llm_on_genie) tutorial to run with the Genie runtime. Note: Genie support will be deprecated soon.


## Setup
### 1. Install the package
Install the package via pip:
```bash
# NOTE: 3.10 <= PYTHON_VERSION < 3.14 is supported.
pip install "qai-hub-models[qwen3-vl-8b-instruct]"
```
For qwen3_vl_8b_instruct, some additional functionality can be faster or is available
only with a GPU on the host machine.

- 🟢 Exporting the model for on-device deployment (GPU not required)
- 🟡 Running the demo (GPU recommended for speed, but not required)
- 🟡 Running evaluation (GPU recommended for speed, but not required)
- 🔴 Quantizing the model (GPU required)

If you are quantizing your own variant of qwen3_vl_8b_instruct, a dedicated CUDA enabled
GPU (40 GB VRAM for 3B models to 80 GB VRAM for 8B models) is recommended. A GPU
can also increase the speed of evaluation and demo of your quantized model
significantly but it not strictly required.

Install the GPU package via pip:
```bash
# NOTE: 3.10 <= PYTHON_VERSION < 3.14 is supported.
pip install "qai-hub-models[qwen3-vl-8b-instruct]" onnxruntime-gpu==1.23.2 https://github.com/qualcomm/aimet/releases/download/2.33.0/aimet_onnx-2.33.0+cu126-cp310-abi3-manylinux_2_34_x86_64.whl -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

### 2. Configure Qualcomm® AI Hub Workbench
Sign-in to [Qualcomm® AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com/) with your
Qualcomm® ID. Once signed in navigate to `Account -> Settings -> API Token`.

With this API token, you can configure your client to run models on the cloud
hosted devices.
```bash
qai-hub configure --api_token API_TOKEN
```
Navigate to [docs](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com/docs/) for more information.

## Run CLI Demo
Run the following simple CLI demo to verify the model is working end to end:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.qwen3_vl_8b_instruct.demo
```
More details on the CLI tool can be found with the `--help` option. See
[demo.py](demo.py) for sample usage of the model including pre/post processing
scripts. Please refer to our [general instructions on using
models](../../../#getting-started) for more usage instructions.

## Export for on-device deployment
To run the model on Qualcomm® devices, you must export the model for use with an edge runtime such as
TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, or Qualcomm AI Engine Direct. Use the following command to export the model:
```bash
qai-hub-models export qwen3_vl_8b_instruct --target-runtime geniex_qairt --precision w4a16 --device "Samsung Galaxy S25 (Family)"
```
Additional options are documented with the `--help` option.
